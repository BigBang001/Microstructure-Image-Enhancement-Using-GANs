# Microstructure Image Enhancement Using GANs

Enhancing microstructure images is critical for materials science research, enabling clearer analysis and better understanding of material properties. This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** framework to reconstruct high-quality, denoised images from noisy, low-resolution microstructure inputs using TensorFlow 2.x.

---
## üîç Project Overview

- **Objective:** Develop a computer vision-based framework to enhance, analyze, and reconstruct microstructure images for improved visualization and analysis.
- **Approach:** Utilize a GAN with residual blocks in the generator and a CNN discriminator to learn mapping from noisy low-res images to high-quality outputs.
- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10 is used as a demo dataset to simulate noisy, low-resolution images. The framework is designed to be easily extended to real microstructure datasets.
- **Interactive Demo:** A Streamlit app allows users to upload images and see enhanced outputs instantly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/microstructure-gan-enhancement.git
cd microstructure-gan-enhancement
````

### Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Train the GAN model

```bash
python train_gan.py
```

*This will train the GAN on the CIFAR-10 dataset, simulating microstructure image enhancement, and save the generator model.*

### Run the interactive demo app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the Streamlit app in your browser, upload an image, and see the GAN-enhanced output!

## üîÆ Future Work

* Train and validate on actual microstructure image datasets.
* Incorporate super-resolution and attention mechanisms for better image quality.
* Add quantitative metrics such as PSNR and SSIM for objective evaluation.
* Deploy as a scalable web service for materials science researchers.
* Integrate domain-specific image analysis and feature extraction.
